# slack

This is a GPTScript tool for interacting with Slack workspaces. It can search for messages, and list the channels and users in the workspace.

## Setup and Usage

1. Create a new Slack app in your workspace.
2. Give your app the following User Token scopes:
   - `channels:read`
   - `channels:history`
   - `search:read`
   - `users:read`
3. Install the app to your workspace.
4. Get your User OAuth Token from the app's "OAuth & Permissions" page.
5. Set the token to the environment variable `GPTSCRIPT_SLACK_TOKEN`.
6. Now you can use the tool in a script:
